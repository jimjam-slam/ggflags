# ggflags 0.0.3

- Adds Rémi Thériault as an author and contributor!
- Package now complies with R CMD CHECK, paving the way for possible CRAN submission in the future!
- The package will also promptly be available on https://jimjam-slam.r-universe.dev

# 0.0.2

- Fork from ellisp/ggflags
- Switches from the use of rectangular PNG flags in ellisp/ggflags to circular SVG flags. This makes them much better for plotting at high resolution, and especially for use in bubble plots.
